BlackJack - attempt

This is a simplified version of the BlackJack card game. The game has only one player and a dealer. A player is dealt cards (called a hand), each of which has a point value. The objective of the game is to get as close to 21 points as possible without going over. A player that goes over is out of the game.

Game Rules

The player starts the game first by getting two cards from the deck. If the player goes over 21 points the game is over and the player looses. If the player gets 21 points the game automaticaly advances to dealer which will have to get a minimum of 17 points. If the dealer goes over 21 points then the game is over and the player wins. If both the player and the dealer have the same points total then the dealer wins. Otherwidse the game is won by whoever has the most points.

There is one exception to this rule: if either the player and the dealer totals 22 points from just the first two cards (two ace's) that is considered BlackJack and not bust. 

Card values:
1 - 11  = value represented by the number
12 - 13 = 10 points (J, Q, K)
